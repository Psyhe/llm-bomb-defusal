Okay, let's see. The defuser needs to determine which wire to cut from the bomb's configuration. The serial number is G2VIEM, so the wires are yellow, white, red. The available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3.

First, check the manual section. The case is a 3-wire case. The rule says if no red wires, cut the second. But here, there's a red wire. Then, if the last wire is white, cut the last. The last wire here is red, so that's not it. So according to the rule, since there's a red wire, and the last wire is red, which is the third wire. So cut wire 3? Wait, the options are cut wire 1, 2, 3. So the answer would be cut wire 3. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the manual says for a 3-wire case: if no red, cut 2. Otherwise, if last wire is white, cut last. Since there's a red wire, which is the third wire, and the last wire is red. So that's the third wire. So cut wire 3. So the instruction would be to cut wire 3.

Okay, let's break this down. The bomb has a 3-wire case. The serial number is G2VIEM. The wires are yellow, white, red. 

Looking at the rules for a 3-wire case: 
1. If no red wires, cut the second. 
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last. 
3. Otherwise, cut the last wire. 

Since there is a red wire, the first condition applies. The third wire is red, so the last wire is red. Therefore, according to the rule, we should cut the last wire (wire 3). 

So the correct action is to cut wire 3.<|im_end|>

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bomb State, and I need to figure out the next step based on the given manual. The defuser has a blue button labeled "Abort" with 1 battery and a lit CAR indicator.

But wait, the available commands are "press" and "hold". The button says "Abort", so pressing it would trigger the bomb. But according to the manual, if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. Wait, maybe there's a conflict here. Let me check the primary analysis again.

The primary analysis says: If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button. So even though the button is labeled "Abort", pressing it would do the same as holding. But the available commands are press and hold. So the defuser has to choose between pressing and holding. But according to the manual, if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. So the instruction should be to hold the button. But maybe the answer depends on the available commands. Wait, the available commands are press and hold. The defuser can choose between those. 

But according to the manual, if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. So the instruction is to hold the button. But let me check again. The primary analysis says: if blue and labeled Abort, hold. So yes, the defuser should hold. But maybe the answer is to hold. However, the user wants the instruction. So the instruction would be to hold the button. But wait, maybe there's another consideration. Let me check the other options. 

The other options are if there are more than two batteries and FRK lit, press and release. But in this case, there's only 1 battery. So no. The other colors: yellow, red, white. But the button is blue. So yes, the instruction is to hold the button. Therefore, the instruction for the Defuser is to hold the button.

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user is in the "Bomb State" with specific attributes: a blue button labeled "Abort", 1 battery, and a lit CAR indicator. 

First, I need to apply the primary analysis. According to the manual, if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", the defuser should hold it. The available commands are "press" and "hold". Since the button is blue and labeled "Abort", the correct action is to hold it. 

I should check if there are any other conditions that might require holding. The other attributes include a single battery and a CAR indicator, which don't trigger any pressing. The manual also mentions that if a held button has a white strip (like CAR), you hold. But here, the button is blue and labeled "Abort", so holding is the right choice. 

Therefore, the defuser should hold the button. The instruction is straightforward. No conflicting options are present, so the correct command is to hold the button.<|im_end|>

So according to the primary analysis, since the button is blue and labeled "Hold", which is the same as "Abort" but different labels, the correct action is to hold it.

Then, the Releasing a Held Button instruction says if the button is held, release when the countdown shows 4, 1, 5, or 1. But the button is blue with a red strip. The primary analysis already tells us to hold it. So the Defuser should hold the button. 

Wait, but the initial instruction says to provide one instruction. So the answer should be to hold the button. Let me check again. Yes, the button is blue and labeled "Hold", so according to the primary analysis, hold. Therefore, the instruction is to hold the button.
</think>

Hold the blue button labeled "Hold" as it is already determined to be a "Abort" button based on the color and label.<|im_end|>

### Bomb State
=== BOMB STATE ===

Button: blue button labeled 'Hold'
Batteries: 1
Lit indicators: CAR, FRK
You are holding the button. A red colored strip is visible.


Available commands:
  release on 1
  release on 4
  release on 5



### Manual Section
## The Button Module

This module presents a single colored button with a text label. The defuser will see the button's color, label, 
number of batteries, and any lit indicators on the bomb. Based on these attributes, you must determine whether 
the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.

### Instruction

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bomb State, and the Defuser needs to decide whether to hold or release the button. The current state shows a blue button labeled "Hold" with 1 battery and a red strip. 

Looking at the manual, the Primary Analysis says that if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. But here, the button is labeled "Hold" and the color is blue. Wait, the button says "Hold" but the color is blue. So according to the primary analysis, since the button is blue and labeled "Hold", which is the same as "Abort" but different labels, the correct action is to hold it.

Then, the Releasing a Held Button instruction says if the button is held, release when the countdown shows 4, 1, 5, or 1. But the button is blue with a red strip. The primary analysis already tells us to hold it. So the Defuser should hold the button.

Okay, the user is in the Bomb State, and the Defuser needs to decide whether to hold or release the button. The current state shows a blue button labeled "Hold" with 1 battery and a red strip. 

Looking at the manual, the Primary Analysis states that if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. However, the button here is labeled "Hold" and the color is blue. Wait, does "Abort" and "Hold" have any relation? The manual says "if the button is blue and labeled 'Abort': Hold". But in this case, the button is labeled "Hold". That might be a typo or a mix-up. 

But according to the primary analysis, if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold it. However, the current button is labeled "Hold" and the color is blue. So maybe there's a confusion here. But the user's instruction says to follow the manual. 

Wait, the manual says: "If the button is blue and labeled 'Abort': Hold". So if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", then hold. But in this case, the button is labeled "Hold". So perhaps the correct action is to hold it, regardless of the label. 

Alternatively, maybe the label "Hold" is a red herring. The primary analysis says that if the button is blue and labeled "Abort", hold. But here, the button is blue and labeled "Hold". So the correct action is to hold. 

Therefore, the instruction is to hold the button. The available commands are release on 1, 4, 5. Since the button is blue and labeled "Hold", the correct action is to hold. So the answer is to hold the button.<|im_end|>

## Simon Says Module

This module presents a sequence of flashing colored lights that the defuser must repeat in a specific order.
The sequence gets longer with each successful round. The correct buttons to press depend on the colors shown,
the serial number, and the current round number.

Serial Number Rules:
- If the serial number contains a vowel (A, E, I, O, U):

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Blue          | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |
  | Green         | Yellow  | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     |
  | Yellow        | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Yellow  | Blue    |

- If the serial number does NOT contain a vowel:

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  | Green   | Blue    |
  | Blue          | Yellow  | Blue    | Green   | Red     | Green   |
  | Green         | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Yellow        | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |

For each color that flashes, tell the defuser which color button to press according to the tables above.
The sequence will get longer with each successful round. If the defuser makes a mistake, the module will
explode immediately.

Okay, let's see. The user is a Defuser trying to complete the Bomb State sequence. The sequence is SST1BB, which is the serial number. The round is 1/5, and the sequence is blue. The available commands are red, blue, green, yellow.

First, I need to check if the serial number contains vowels. The serial number is SST1BB. Let's look at each letter. S, T, S, 1, B, B. The vowels here are A, E, I, O, U. The letters here are S, T, S, 1, B, B. None of them are vowels. So according to the rules, the color for round 1 is blue. The corresponding button is blue. So the Defuser should press the blue button.

Wait, but the sequence is blue, so the correct button is blue. So the instruction would be to press blue. But I need to make sure there's no other step. The sequence gets longer with each round, but since it's round 1, the only action is pressing blue. So the answer is to press blue.

The Defuser should press the **blue** button.<|im_end|>
