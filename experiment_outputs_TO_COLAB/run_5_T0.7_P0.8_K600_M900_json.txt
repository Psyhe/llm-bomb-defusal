## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a module for determining which wire to cut based on the configuration and the serial number. The defuser has the serial number TM3BNT and the wires in the 3-Wire Case. Let me parse through the input and apply the rules.

First, the defuser's observation says the wires are yellow, red, and white. The available commands are cutting wire 1, 2, or 3. The problem is to determine which wire to cut based on the configuration and the serial number.

Looking at the 3-Wire Case rules:

1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

In this case, there is one red wire. The last wire is white. So according to rule 2, cut the last wire. But wait, the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. Wait, the wires are 1, 2, 3. The last wire is wire 3. So according to rule 2, cut wire 3. But the output expects a command. So the answer would be cut wire 3. Let me check if there's any other rule that applies here.

Looking at the 4-Wire Case and beyond, but since the case is 3-wire, the answer is straightforward. The serial number is TM3BNT, which has the last digit 9 (odd). The wires are yellow (1), red (2), white (3). So rule 2 applies. Therefore, the correct command is cut wire 3.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a module for determining which wire to cut based on the configuration and the serial number. The defuser has the serial number TM3BNT and the wires in the 3-Wire Case. Let me parse through the input and apply the rules.

First, the defuser's observation says the wires are yellow, red, and white. The available commands are cutting wire 1, 2, or 3. The problem is to determine which wire to cut based on the configuration and the serial number.

Looking at the 3-Wire Case rules:

1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

In this case, there is one red wire. The last wire is white. So according to rule 2, cut the last wire. But wait, the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. Wait, the wires are 1, 2, 3. The last wire is wire 3. So according to rule 2, cut wire 3. But the output expects a command. So the answer would be cut wire 3. Let me check if there's any other rule that applies here.

Looking at the 4-Wire Case and beyond, but since the case is 3-wire, the answer is straightforward. The serial number is TM3BNT, which has the last digit 9 (odd). The wires are yellow (1), red (2), white (3). So rule 2 applies. Therefore, the correct command is cut wire 3.

Okay, let me go through the problem again. The defuser has the serial number TM3BNT and the wires in the 3-Wire Case: yellow, red, white. The available commands are cutting wire 1, 2, or 3. 

The 3-Wire Case rules are as follows:

- If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
- If the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
- Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

In this case, there is one red wire. The last wire is white. So according to rule 2, cut the last wire, which is wire 3. Therefore, the correct command is to cut wire 3. I need to confirm that there's no conflicting rule or other conditions. The serial number ends with an odd digit (9), which might influence other rules, but since the case is 3-wire, the rule about the serial number in the 4-Wire or higher cases doesn't apply here. So the answer is clear. The selected command is cut wire 3.

First, looking at the defuser's observation: the button is yellow labeled 'Detonate', there are 2 batteries, and a lit indicator labeled CAR. The rules for the button's color and label are important here.

The primary analysis section says if the button is yellow, hold it. Since the button is yellow and labeled 'Detonate', that matches the condition. But wait, the defuser's observation mentions a lit indicator labeled CAR. However, the primary analysis only checks the color and label. The CAR indicator might be part of the lighting system, but the rules don't mention anything about that. The rules list specific cases like more than one battery, etc. So even if there's a CAR indicator, the primary analysis still applies. 

The releasing part says if the held button has a specific color, release at certain times. Since the button is yellow, according to the primary analysis, hold it. But the defuser's observation includes the CAR indicator. However, the rules don't specify anything about that. So maybe the CAR indicator isn't part of the main analysis here. The defuser's observation is just the current state, so the main decision is based on the color and label. 

So the answer should be to hold the button because it's yellow and labeled 'Detonate'. The release part isn't triggered since the conditions for releasing aren't met. Therefore, the output is to hold the button.

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user provided a JSON object where the "role" is "Defuser", "input" includes "expert_advice" and "defuser_observation", and the "output" is the command to return. 

First, I need to parse the "expert_advice" to understand the rules. The advice specifies conditions based on the button's color, label, number of batteries, and lit indicators. The defuser's observation states the button is yellow labeled "Detonate", has 2 batteries, and a lit indicator labeled CAR. 

Looking at the primary analysis, if the button is yellow and labeled "Detonate", the defuser should hold it. The CAR indicator might be a lit indicator, but according to the rules, the main factors are color, label, batteries, and lit indicators. The rules don't mention CAR as a separate condition, so it's likely part of the lighting system but not affecting the main decision. 

The available commands are "press" and "hold". Since the button is yellow and labeled "Detonate", the defuser should hold it. The releasing part isn't triggered here because the conditions for releasing aren't met. 

Therefore, the correct command is to hold the button. The output should reflect that.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a command format for a button module and needs to determine if the defuser should press and release the button based on the given attributes.

First, let's parse the input. The button is yellow labeled "Detonate". There are 2 batteries and a lit indicator labeled CAR. The defuser is holding the button, and there's a blue strip visible. 

Looking at the primary analysis section, the conditions are:

- If button is yellow: Hold the button. Since the button is yellow, that's the case. The defuser is holding it, so they should hold it.

Then, the releasing a held button part. The blue strip is visible, and the timer needs to show 4 for release. The available commands are release on 1, 4, 5. So the correct command here would be release on 4.

Wait, but the question says "output" which is a single command. So the answer should be the command that the defuser should use. The options are release on 1, 4, 5. Since the blue strip requires 4, the correct command is release on 4. So the output is "release on 4".

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user provided a JSON structure where the "defuser_observation" includes the current state of the button and the available commands. The task is to determine the correct command based on the given advice.

The button is yellow labeled "Detonate", with 2 batteries and a lit indicator labeled CAR. The defuser is holding the button, and there's a blue strip visible. 

According to the primary analysis, if the button is yellow, the defuser should hold it. Since the blue strip is visible, the releasing part requires a countdown timer. The available commands are release on 1, 4, or 5. The blue strip corresponds to a countdown of 4, so the correct command is release on 4. 

I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. The battery count is 2, which doesn't affect the current state. The CAR indicator is lit, but that's already considered in the initial analysis. So the final answer is release on 4.<|im_end|>

[EXPERT sees MANUAL]:
## Simon Says Module

This module presents a sequence of flashing colored lights that the defuser must repeat in a specific order.
The sequence gets longer with each successful round. The correct buttons to press depend on the colors shown,
the serial number, and the current round number.

Serial Number Rules:
- If the serial number contains a vowel (A, E, I, O, U):

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Blue          | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |
  | Green         | Yellow  | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     |
  | Yellow        | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Yellow  | Blue    |

- If the serial number does NOT contain a vowel:

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  | Green   | Blue    |
  | Blue          | Yellow  | Blue    | Green   | Red     | Green   |
  | Green         | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Yellow        | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |

For each color that flashes, tell the defuser which color button to press according to the tables above.
The sequence will get longer with each successful round. If the defuser makes a mistake, the module will
explode immediately.

The output should be a single command that summarizes this information. The user wants the output to be a command that the defuser can use. Since the defuser is supposed to repeat the sequence, the command should be something like "Press red" based on the flashing sequence provided. 

But wait, the flashing sequence is "red". The available commands are "press red", "press blue", etc. So the correct command here is "press red". 

I need to make sure that the output is concise and matches the structure. The JSON provided already includes the commands in the "available commands" section. Since the user's observation shows the sequence is red, the command should be "press red". 

So the final command output should be "press red".
