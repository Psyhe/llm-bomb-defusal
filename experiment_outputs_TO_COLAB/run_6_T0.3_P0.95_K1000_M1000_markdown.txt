## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

### Instruction

Okay, let's see. The defuser needs to determine which wire to cut from the bomb's configuration. The serial number is 0SUUUJ, so the last digit is 'J'. Let's look at the wire colors and the case type.

The case is a 6-wire module. The wires are red, blue, black, yellow, black, black. The serial number ends with 'J', which is odd. 

Looking at the 6-Wire Case instructions. The first condition is if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd. There are no yellow wires here, so that's true. Then, according to the instruction, cut the third wire. The third wire is black. So the answer should be cut wire 3. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Yes, the third wire is black, and since there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, that's the correct action. So the instruction would be to cut wire 3.

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The bomb has a 6-wire module with specific colors: red, blue, black, yellow, black, black. The serial number is 0SUUUJ, so the last digit is 'J', which is odd. 

First, I need to check the case type. The case is a 6-wire module. Now, applying the rules for a 6-wire case. The first condition is if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd. Let's confirm the colors. The wires are red, blue, black, yellow, black, black. There are no yellow wires here, so that condition is met. The last digit is 'J', which is odd. According to the instruction for a 6-wire case, if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third wire. The third wire is black, so cutting it would be the correct action. I need to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Yes, that seems right. The answer is to cut wire 3.<|im_end|>
