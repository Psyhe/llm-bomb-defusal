This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser has a 3-Wire Case setup with wires yellow, red, and blue. The serial number is G4ZBLR. The available commands are cutting one of the wires. 

First, I need to check the manual's rules for a 3-Wire Case. The first rule says if no wires are red, cut the second. But here, there are red wires (the third wire is red). Wait, the serial number is G4ZBLR. Let me parse that. The serial number is G4ZBLR. Breaking it down: the first digit is G, then 4, then Z, then B, then L, then R. So the wires are yellow (Wire 1?), red (Wire 3?), blue (Wire 2?).

Wait, the wires are labeled Wire 1: yellow, Wire 2: red, Wire 3: blue. So Wire 2 is red. The serial number's last digit is R, which is the third wire. So according to the 3-Wire Case rules, since there are red wires (Wire 2), but the last wire is blue. The first rule says if no reds, cut second. But here, there are reds. So the second rule says if the last wire is white, cut last. But here, the last wire is blue. So the third rule says if the last wire is white, cut last. But here, the last wire is blue. So the third rule doesn't apply. So according to the third rule, since there are reds, but the last wire is blue, which isn't white, so the third rule isn't triggered. So the third rule isn't applicable. Then the first rule says if no reds, cut second. But there are reds. So maybe the answer is to cut the second wire? Wait, but the first rule says if no reds, cut second. But here, there are reds. So maybe the answer is to cut the second wire? Or maybe the third rule applies? Let me check again.

The 3-Wire Case rules:

1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.

2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.

3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

So in this case, there are red wires (Wire 2 is red). The last wire is blue. So according to rule 1, if no reds, cut second. But since there are reds, rule 1 isn't triggered. Then rule 2: if last wire is white, cut last. But here, last wire is blue. So rule 2 isn't triggered. So rule 3: else, cut last. So in this case, since there are reds, and the last wire is blue, the third rule applies. So the

Okay, let's break this down. The Defuser is working on a 3-Wire Case with wires: Wire 1 (yellow), Wire 2 (red), Wire 3 (blue). The serial number is G4ZBLR. 

First, the manual's rules for a 3-Wire Case:

1. If no red wires, cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise, cut the last wire.

So in this case, there are red wires (Wire 2). The last wire is Wire 3, which is blue. So according to rule 3, since there are reds, the third rule applies. Therefore, the Defuser should cut the last wire (Wire 3). 

But wait, the options are to cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So the answer would be to cut wire 3. But let me double-check. The manual says "if the last wire is white, cut last". Since the last wire here is blue, not white, so rule 3 applies. Therefore, the correct action is to cut the last wire, which is Wire 3. So the answer is cut wire 3.

First, looking at the manual's button module. The button is red and labeled 'Detonate'. According to the primary analysis, if the button is red and says "Detonate", then the defuser should press and immediately release. 

Wait, but the available commands are press and hold. So the correct action here is to press. But let me check the manual again to make sure. The primary analysis says if the button is red and says "Detonate", press and release. Yes. 

Then, there's the releasing a held button part. But since the button is already in the 'Detonate' state, pressing it would trigger the detonation. The manual also mentions that if there's a colored strip, release at specific times. But since the button is already in the 'Detonate' state, pressing it would activate the detonation.

## Simon Says Module

This module presents a sequence of flashing colored lights that the defuser must repeat in a specific order.
The sequence gets longer with each successful round. The correct buttons to press depend on the colors shown,
the serial number, and the current round number.

Serial Number Rules:
- If the serial number contains a vowel (A, E, I, O, U):

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Blue          | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |
  | Green         | Yellow  | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     |
  | Yellow        | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Yellow  | Blue    |

- If the serial number does NOT contain a vowel:

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  | Green   | Blue    |
  | Blue          | Yellow  | Blue    | Green   | Red     | Green   |
  | Green         | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Yellow        | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |

For each color that flashes, tell the defuser which color button to press according to the tables above.
The sequence will get longer with each successful round. If the defuser makes a mistake, the module will
explode immediately.

## Simon Says Module

This module presents a sequence of flashing colored lights that the defuser must repeat in a specific order.
The sequence gets longer with each successful round. The correct buttons to press depend on the colors shown,
the serial number, and the current round number.

Serial Number Rules:
- If the serial number contains a vowel (A, E, I, O, U):

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Blue          | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |
  | Green         | Yellow  | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     |
  | Yellow        | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Yellow  | Blue    |

- If the serial number does NOT contain a vowel:

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  | Green   | Blue    |
  | Blue          | Yellow  | Blue    | Green   | Red     | Green   |
  | Green         | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Yellow        | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |

For each color that flashes, tell the defuser which color button to press according to the tables above.
The sequence will get longer with each successful round. If the defuser makes a mistake, the module will
explode immediately.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser needs to follow the sequence of colors given by Simon. The sequence is green, and the available buttons are red, blue, green, yellow. The user has to press a colored button to start the sequence.

First, the manual says that the correct button depends on the color shown, the serial number, and the round number. The serial number is EP9TRT, which contains a vowel. Let me check the table for that. The table has a row for EP9TRT. Looking at the first row, if the serial number has a vowel, the color is red. Wait, the first row's color is red for Round 1, and the serial number EP9TRT has a vowel (T?), but maybe I need to check again. Wait, the serial number is EP9TRT. Let me spell it out: E, P, 9, T, R, T. So the letters are E, P, 9, T, R, T. The vowels here are E and T? Wait, T is a vowel? No, in English, T is a consonant. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. So in EP9TRT, the letters are E, P, 9, T, R, T. The vowels here are E and T? Wait, T is a consonant. So only E is a vowel. So the serial number has a vowel, so according to the table, the color is red. So the first color is red. Therefore, the Defuser needs to press red. But the available commands are press red, blue, green, yellow. So the answer here would be to press red. But wait, the sequence is green. Wait, the problem says that the sequence is green. So the Defuser needs to press green. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check again. The sequence is green. So the first color is green. But according to the table, the first row's color is red for Round 1. Wait, maybe the table is for Round 1. Let me check again. The table shows for each round, the color. The first row is Round 1, and the color is red. So if the sequence is green, then the first color is green. But according to the table, the first row's color is red. Wait, maybe the table is for Round 1, and the sequence is green. So the Defuser needs to press green. But the available buttons are red, blue, green, yellow. So the answer would be to press green. But why is the first color green? Because the sequence is green. So the Defuser needs to press green. But according to the table, the first color is red. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here.

Okay, let's go through this again. The sequence is green. The Defuser needs to press the correct button. The available commands are red, blue, green, yellow. The manual says that the correct button depends on the color shown, the serial number, and the round number. The serial number is EP9TRT, which contains a vowel. Looking at the table, the first row (Round 1) has red as the color. But the sequence is green. Wait, maybe the table is for Round 1, and the sequence is green. So the first color is green. Therefore, the Defuser needs to press green. But according to the table, Round 1's color is red. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the table again. The first row says for Round 1, color is red. But the sequence is green. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the sequence is green, so the first color is green. Therefore, the Defuser needs to press green. But according to the table, Round 1's color is red. So perhaps the table is for Round 1, and the sequence is green. Therefore, the answer is to press green. But the available commands include green. So the correct command is press green. Therefore, the Defuser should press green.
