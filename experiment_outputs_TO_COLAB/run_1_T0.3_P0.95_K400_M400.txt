## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a manual excerpt about how to cut a wire based on the serial number and the number of wires. The current state has a serial number of PGHQ0K and wires arranged in a 6-wire case. The wires are:

Wire 1: white  
Wire 2: red  
Wire 3: black  
Wire 4: yellow  
Wire 5: yellow  
Wire 6: white  

The task is to determine which wire to cut based on the given rules. Let me go through each case step by step.

First, the 6-Wire Case. The rules are:

1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.  
2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.  
3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.  
4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.  

Looking at the wires: there are two yellow wires (5 and 4) and two white wires (1 and 6). The last digit of the serial number is 0, which is even. So the first condition is not met. The second condition says if there's exactly one yellow and more than one white. Here, there are two yellow and two white. So condition 2 is not met. Then, since there are no red wires, condition 3 applies. So the last wire (wire 6) should be cut. But wait, the user's available commands include cutting wire 6. So the answer would be cut wire 6. Let me check again. The serial number ends with 0, which is even. So the first condition (no yellow and odd last digit) is not met. The second condition (exactly one yellow and more than one white) is not met. So the third condition (no red

Okay, let's see. The user provided the current state of the bomb with serial number PGHQ0K and wires arranged in a 6-wire case. The wires are:

Wire 1: white  
Wire 2: red  
Wire 3: black  
Wire 4: yellow  
Wire 5: yellow  
Wire 6: white  

The available commands are to cut any of the wires 1-6. The expert's advice has specific rules for different wire counts. The current state is a 6-wire case. Let's check the rules for the 6-wire case.

The 6-Wire Case rules:

1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.  
2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.  
3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.  
4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.  

Looking at the wires: there are two yellow wires (wire 4 and 5) and two white wires (wire 1 and 6). The last digit of the serial number is 0, which is even. So condition 1 is not met. Condition 2: exactly one yellow and more than one white? Here, there are two yellow and two white. So condition 2 is not met. Then, check if there are no red wires. Wire 2 is red, so condition 3 is not met. Since there are no red wires, condition 3 applies. Therefore, the last wire (wire 6) should be cut. So the correct instruction is to cut wire 6.
