This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a scenario where a defuser needs to determine which wire to cut from a bomb. The serial number is ZMBEV8, and the wires are yellow, red, yellow, red. The available commands are cutting any of the four wires.

First, I need to check the manual section for the correct method. The problem mentions that the case is a 3-wire case. The manual says that if no wires are red, cut the second wire. But in this case, there are two red wires. Then, if the last wire is white, cut the last one. But here, the last wire is yellow. So according to the 3-wire case, since there are red wires, and the last wire is yellow, cut the last wire. Wait, but the wires are in the order yellow, red, yellow, red. So wire 1 is yellow, wire 2 is red, wire 3 is yellow, wire 4 is red. The last wire is wire 4, which is red. So according to the manual, since there are red wires, and the last wire is red, which is not white, then the instruction would be to cut the last wire (wire 4). But the user's instruction might be to cut wire 3 or wire 4. Wait, the manual says if there are red wires, and the last wire is white, cut the last. But here, the last wire is red. So according to the manual, since there are red wires, but the last is red, so cut the last wire. But the wires are in the order given. So the correct wire to cut is wire 4. But the user's instruction is to provide one. So the answer should be to cut wire 4. But wait, let me check again. The manual says for 3-wire case: if no red, cut second. Otherwise, if last is white, cut last. Otherwise, cut last. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse the manual again. The 3-wire case says: 1. If no wires are red: Cut second. 2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut last. 3. Otherwise: Cut last. So if there are red wires, but the last wire is white, cut last. But if there are red wires and the last wire is red, then cut last. Wait, but the manual says "otherwise, if the last wire is white: cut last. Otherwise: cut last." Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the manual. Alternatively, maybe the 3-wire case is a typo. Let me check again. The manual says for 3-wire case: "If no wires are red: Cut the second wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire. Otherwise: Cut

Okay, let's go through this again. The bomb has serial number ZMBEV8, wires are yellow, red, yellow, red. The case is a 3-wire case. The manual says for 3-wire case: if no red, cut second. Otherwise, if last wire is white, cut last. Otherwise, cut last. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the manual has a typo. Let me check again. The 3-wire case instructions: "If no wires are red: Cut the second wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire. Otherwise: Cut the last wire." Hmm, the "otherwise" part is a bit confusing. Maybe it's supposed to be "otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last. Otherwise, if there are no red wires, cut the second." But the way it's written, perhaps the "otherwise" is part of the same condition. Alternatively, maybe the 3-wire case's instruction is: if there are no red wires, cut second. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut last. Otherwise, cut last. So in this case, since there are red wires, but the last wire is yellow, then according to the manual, since there are red wires, and the last is yellow, so cut the last wire. But the wires are in the order yellow, red, yellow, red. So wire 1 is yellow, wire 2 is red, wire 3 is yellow, wire 4 is red. The last wire is wire 4, which is red. So according to the manual, since there are red wires, and the last wire is red, so cut the last wire. Therefore, the command should be to cut wire 4. But the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, 3, 4. So the answer is to cut wire 4.

## The Button Module

This module presents a single colored button with a text label. The defuser will see the button's color, label, 
number of batteries, and any lit indicators on the bomb. Based on these attributes, you must determine whether 
the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.
