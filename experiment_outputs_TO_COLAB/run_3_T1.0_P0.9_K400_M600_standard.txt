## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The Defuser needs to determine which wire to cut based on the given manual instructions. The problem has a 6-wire case, so that's the case we should focus on.

The serial number is VYVGW1. Let's break that down. The wires are: Wire 1 (black), Wire 2 (yellow), Wire 3 (blue), Wire 4 (white), Wire 5 (yellow). The available commands are cutting any of the wires 1-5.

Looking at the 6-Wire Case section: 

1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.

The serial number's last digit is 1, which is odd. Now, check if there are any yellow wires. Wire 2 is yellow and Wire 5 is also yellow. Wait, there are two yellow wires here. So according to the 6-Wire Case instructions, if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third. But here, there are yellow wires present. So that condition isn't met.

So maybe I need to check the other conditions. The manual says for 6-Wire:

If there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd: cut third.

But since there are yellow wires, that's not the case. Let me look at the other possibilities. The other conditions:

2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: cut the fourth.

But there are two yellow wires (Wire 2 and 5), but white wire is Wire 4 (white). So there is exactly one yellow and more than one white. Wait, Wire 4 is white. So that would be one yellow and one white. But the instruction says "more than one white wire". Wait, so maybe that's not the case either. Let me recheck the 6-Wire instructions.

Wait, the 6-Wire case says:

2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.

So if there's one yellow and more than one white, then cut fourth. In our case, there's Wire 2 (yellow) and Wire 4 (white). So that would mean more than one white? Yes, there is more than one (wire 4 is white, but maybe other whites? Wait, Wire 3 is blue, Wire 1 is black, Wire 2 and 5 are yellow. So only Wire 4 is white. So only one white. Therefore, condition 2 isn't met. 

So then, what's left? The 6-Wire case's instructions don't have a direct condition for this. Maybe there's an error, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the other conditions. The other conditions are:

3. Else

But there are two yellow wires (Wire 2 and 5), but white wire is Wire 4 (white). So there is exactly one yellow and more than one white. Wait, Wire 4 is white. So that would be one yellow and one white. But the instruction says "more than one white wire". Wait, so maybe that's not the case either. Let me recheck the 6-Wire instructions.

Wait, the 6-Wire case says:

2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.

So if there's one yellow and more than one white, then cut fourth. In our case, there's Wire 2 (yellow) and Wire 4 (white). So that would mean more than one white? Yes, there is more than one (wire 4 is white, but maybe other whites? Wait, Wire 3 is blue, Wire 1 is black, Wire 2 and 5 are yellow. So only Wire 4 is white. So only one white. Therefore, condition 2 isn't met.

Okay, let's go back. The serial number is VYVGW1. The wires are:

Wire 1: black

Wire 2: yellow

Wire 3: blue

Wire 4: white

Wire 5: yellow

The 6-Wire Case requires checking if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd. But here, there are yellow wires. So that's not the case. Then, the next possible condition is:

The manual says for 6-Wire:

If there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd: cut third

Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: cut fourth

Else, if there are no red wires: cut last wire

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there are any red wires. The wires are black (1), yellow (2 and 5), blue (3), white (4). There are no red wires here. So condition 3 would apply: cut last wire. But the last wire is Wire 5 (yellow). Wait, but there's also Wire 2 and 5 as yellow. But according to the 6-Wire case, if there are no red wires, cut the last wire. But the last wire is Wire 5. However, Wire 5 is yellow. But if the last wire is white, then maybe another condition applies. Wait, the manual's 6-Wire section:

2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: cut the fourth wire.

3. Else, if there are no red wires: cut the last wire.

But in our case, there are no red wires. So according to that, cut the last wire. But the last wire is Wire 5 (yellow). So cut wire 5. But according to the initial analysis, since there are yellow wires, maybe the condition wasn't met. But according to the instruction, if there are no red wires, cut the last wire. But there are no red wires here. So the correct command would be cut wire 5.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The manual says for 6-Wire:

2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: cut fourth.

3. Else, if there are no red wires: cut last wire.

So in our case, there are no red wires, so according to condition 3, cut the last wire. Which is Wire 5. But Wire 5 is yellow. However, there are yellow wires, but the condition is only if there are no red. Since there are no red, then cut last wire. So the Defuser should cut wire 5.

Wait, but the available commands include cutting wire 5. So the correct action is cut wire 5. That's the answer.
