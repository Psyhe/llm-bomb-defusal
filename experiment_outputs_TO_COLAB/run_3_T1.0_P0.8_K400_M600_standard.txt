## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser has this information about a bomb with serial number NT0XAT and three wires: red, white, and blue. The available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. The manual has different rules for 3, 4, 5, and 6 wire cases. The serial number is NT0XAT. 

First, I need to check the manual's section for each case. The 3-wire case says if no red, cut second; else if last is white, cut last. But here, there are three wires, all red? Wait, the colors are red, white, blue. Wait, the manual's wires are between 3-6, so 3-wire case. But in this case, the serial number is NT0XAT. Let me check the manual again. 

Wait, the problem says the manual has a section for the regular wires module. The user provided a section with the 3-wire case, and the Defuser needs to determine which wire to cut based on the colors and serial number. 

In this case, the wires are red, white, and blue. So, the first wire is red. According to the 3-wire case instructions: if no wires are red, cut second. But here, there are wires. So the first wire is red. So according to the first rule: if no red, cut second. But since there are red wires, the second rule applies: if last is white, cut last. But here, the last wire is blue. So the second rule says if the last wire is white, cut last. Since it's blue, we don't cut last. So maybe the correct action is to cut wire 1. Wait, but according to the manual, for 3-wire case, if no red, cut second. Otherwise, if last is white, cut last. Else, cut last. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. 

Original text: "3-Wire Case:
1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire."

So if there are red wires, then check if last is white. If yes, cut last. Else, cut last. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the correct interpretation is: if there are no red wires, cut second. Otherwise, if the last is white, cut last. Else, cut last. Wait, maybe the third case is redundant? Because if there are red wires, the second rule applies. 

Wait, maybe the 3-wire case's third bullet is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct logic is that if no red, cut second. If there are red, then check if last is white. If

Okay, let's go step by step. The Defuser has a bomb with serial number NT0XAT and three wires: red, white, blue. The manual says for 3-wire case:

- If no red wires: cut second.
- Otherwise, if last wire is white: cut last.
- Otherwise: cut last.

So, first, check if there are any red wires. The wires are red, white, blue. So there are red wires. Then check if the last wire (blue) is white. No, it's blue. Therefore, according to the third bullet, cut the last wire. But wait, the third bullet says "Otherwise: Cut the last wire." So even if there are red wires, if the last is not white, cut the last. But the last here is blue, so cut wire 3. 

But the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So the correct action is to cut wire 3. But wait, the user's options are to cut any of the three. So the answer would be cut wire 3. 

But let me double-check. The wires are red, white, blue. So wire 1 is red, wire 2 is white, wire 3 is blue. So the serial number is NT0XAT. Let's see: the manual's 3-wire case instructions. Since there are red wires, check if last wire is white. Here, the last is blue, so we need to follow the third bullet. So cut the last wire, which is wire 3. Therefore, the Defuser should cut wire 3.

## The Button Module

This module presents a single colored button with a text label. The defuser will see the button's color, label, 
number of batteries, and any lit indicators on the bomb. Based on these attributes, you must determine whether 
the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.
