This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a manual excerpt about a wiring module and the current bomb state with the serial number D3VDGB and wires: blue, red, yellow. The available commands are cutting wire 1, 2, or 3.

First, I need to check the configuration based on the given serial number and wires. The serial number is D3VDGB. Let's break that down. The digits are D, 3, V, D, G, B. Let me count the wires: 3, 2, 1. Wait, the wires are in order 1, 2, 3. So Wire 1 is blue, Wire 2 is red, Wire 3 is yellow. 

Now, looking at the commands, the user has to determine which wire to cut. The problem is that the manual has different rules depending on the number of wires and the serial number's digits. Let me check the 3-Wire Case first. The 3-Wire Case says: If no red, cut second. If last wire is white, cut last. Otherwise, last. But in this case, there is one red wire (Wire 2), so according to the first rule, if no red, cut second. But there is a red wire, so maybe the second rule applies? Let me check again. 

Wait, the 3-Wire Case: If no wires are red: cut second. Otherwise, if last wire is white: cut last. Otherwise, cut last. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me re-read. The 3-Wire Case says: 1. If no wires are red: Cut second. 2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut last. 3. Otherwise: Cut last. Wait, that seems confusing. Wait, maybe the original manual has different conditions. Let me check again. The original manual for the 3-Wire Case says:

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

So regardless of the first condition, if there's a red wire, the third condition applies. So in this case, Wire 2 is red. So according to the 3-Wire Case, since there is a red wire, the third condition applies: cut the last wire. But Wire 3 is yellow, so cut wire 3. But according to the available commands, the user can only cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So in this case, the correct instruction would be to cut wire 3. But wait, the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So the answer would be cut wire 3. 

But let me check the other cases. For example, the 4-Wire Case has more detailed rules. But since the current case is 3 wires, and the answer is wire 3. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm again. The serial number is D3VDGB. Let's check the digits. The wires are in order 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (yellow). So the serial number is D, 3, V, D, G, B. Let me check the rules again for the 3-Wire case. 

The 3-Wire Case says: If no wires are red: cut second. Otherwise, if last wire is white: cut last. Otherwise, cut last. Wait, so if there's a red wire, then regardless of whether the last wire is white or not, the third condition applies. But in this case, the last wire is yellow, so the third condition applies, meaning cut the last wire. Which is Wire 3. Therefore, the correct instruction is cut wire 3. 

But the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So the answer should be cut wire 3. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The 3-Wire Case says: If no red: cut second. Otherwise, if last is white: cut last. Otherwise: cut last. Wait, maybe there's a typo and the third condition is if there is no red and last is white, cut last. But in our case, there is a red wire, so the third condition doesn't apply. Therefore, cut last wire. Which is wire 3. 

Yes, so the correct instruction is cut wire 3.

Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. The bomb's serial number is D3VDGB, and the wires are in order: Wire 1 (blue), Wire 2 (red), Wire 3 (yellow). 

First, I need to apply the rules provided in the manual. The user's task is to determine which wire to cut based on the configuration. The available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3.

Looking at the 3-Wire Case: 
1. If no wires are red, cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise, cut the last wire.

In this case, Wire 2 is red. So the first condition (no red) doesn't apply. The second condition (if last wire is white) is not met (last wire is yellow). Therefore, the third condition applies: cut the last wire. The last wire is Wire 3, so the correct instruction is to cut Wire 3. 

Therefore, the final answer is cut wire 3.
