## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

Okay, let's see. The defuser needs to determine which wire to cut from the bomb's configuration. The serial number is YGOM2I. Let me check the manual section for the rules.

First, the case is a 6-wire module. The wires are white, yellow, yellow, red, yellow. The serial number is YGOM2I. Let's break it down step by step.

Looking at the 6-wire case rules. The first rule says if there are no red wires, cut the last wire. But here, there is a red wire (Wire 4). So that's not the case. The second rule says if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third wire. The last digit of YGOM2I is 2, which is even. So that's not applicable. 

Next, the third rule says if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. But there's no black wire mentioned here. The wires are white, yellow, yellow, red, yellow. So no black wires. So according to the third rule, cut the second wire. But wait, the third rule says if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. But the fourth rule says if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third. But here, there are yellow wires. So maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the 6-wire case's third rule is: if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. Since there are no black wires, that's the case. So the answer would be to cut the second wire. But let me confirm once more. The wires are Wire 1: white, Wire 2: yellow, Wire 3: yellow, Wire 4: red, Wire 5: yellow. The serial number is YGOM2I. The last digit is 2, which is even. So according to the third rule, cut the second wire. So the instruction would be to cut wire 2.

Okay, let's go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The bomb has a 6-wire module with wires: 1 (white), 2 (yellow), 3 (yellow), 4 (red), 5 (yellow). The serial number is YGOM2I. The last digit is 2, which is even. 

Looking at the 6-wire case rules: the third rule says if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. Since there are no black wires (only white, yellow, yellow, red, yellow), the second wire (Wire 2) should be cut. That makes sense. I don't see any conflicting rules here. So the correct action is to cut wire 2.<|im_end|>
