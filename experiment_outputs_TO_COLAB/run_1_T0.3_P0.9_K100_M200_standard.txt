## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser has a 3-Wire Case setup with wires: black, red, white. The serial number is 1PGNXK. The available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3.

Looking at the manual, for a 3-Wire Case, the rule is: if no reds, cut the second. If last is white, cut last. Otherwise, cut last. Wait, the third bullet says "Otherwise: Cut the last wire." So regardless of other conditions, cut the last wire. But wait, the first bullet says if no reds, cut second. So maybe the third bullet is redundant? Or maybe I need to check the exact wording.

Wait, the manual says:

Okay, let's break this down. The Defuser is working with a 3-Wire Case. The wires are black, red, and white. The serial number is 1PGNXK. 

First, I need to check the manual's instructions for the 3-Wire Case. The manual says: "Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire." So regardless of other conditions, if the last wire is white, cut the last one. But wait, the first bullet says if no reds, cut the second. So maybe the third bullet is redundant? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the manual. Let me check again.

Wait, the third bullet says "Otherwise: Cut the last wire." So maybe the third bullet is the last one. So the correct approach is to check if the last wire is white. If yes, cut the last wire. But if there are no reds, cut the second. Otherwise, cut the

the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser is given the BOMB STATE with specific details. The button is white labeled 'Detonate', 3 batteries, and lit indicators FRK. The available commands are press or hold.

Looking at the manual's button module instructions. The primary analysis says if the button is white and there's a lit indicator labeled CAR, hold. But here, the indicator is FRK. Wait, the manual says for the button color and label, if it's white and lit indicator is CAR, hold. But here, the indicator is FRK. So maybe the FRK is another indicator? Or maybe the FRK is a different one. Wait, the manual says "lit indicators: FRK". So the FRK is present.

## The Button Module

This module presents a single colored button with a text label. The defuser will see the button's color, label, 
number of batteries, and any lit indicators on the bomb. Based on these attributes, you must determine whether 
the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.

Okay, let's see. The Defuser is in a situation where they have a button labeled 'Detonate' with white color, 3 batteries, and a red strip. The available commands are release on 1, 4, or 5. 

First, looking at the manual for the Button Module. The primary analysis says if the button is white and there's a lit indicator labeled CAR, hold it. But here, the indicators are FRK. Wait, the button is white, and the lit indicators are FRK. So according to the primary analysis, since the button is white and there's a lit indicator labeled FRK, which is one of the conditions listed in the primary analysis, the correct action is to hold the button. 

Then, the manual also mentions that if the button is held, the releasing time depends on the color of the strip. The red strip is visible. The primary analysis says if the button is white and there's a lit

Okay, let's break this down. The Defuser has a button labeled 'Detonate' with a white button. The manual says that if the button is white and there's a lit indicator labeled FRK, they should hold it. The available commands are release on 1, 4, or 5. Since the primary analysis indicates holding the button, the next step is to decide on the command. The manual also mentions that if the button is held, the releasing time depends on the color of the strip. The red strip is visible, so the release command would be based on that. The options are release on 1, 4, or 5. The command that corresponds to releasing when the timer shows any 1 (red strip) is release on 1. Therefore, the Defuser should choose release on 1.

## Simon Says Module

This module presents a sequence of flashing colored lights that the defuser must repeat in a specific order.
The sequence gets longer with each successful round. The correct buttons to press depend on the colors shown,
the serial number, and the current round number.

Serial Number Rules:
- If the serial number contains a vowel (A, E, I, O, U):

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Blue          | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |
  | Green         | Yellow  | Blue    | Yellow  | Green   | Red     |
  | Yellow        | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Yellow  | Blue    |

- If the serial number does NOT contain a vowel:

  | Color Flashed | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
  | Red           | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  | Green   | Blue    |
  | Blue          | Yellow  | Blue    | Green   | Red     | Green   |
  | Green         | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Red     | Yellow  |
  | Yellow        | Red     | Green   | Red     | Blue    | Green   |

For each color that flashes, tell the defuser which color button to press according to the tables above.
The sequence will get longer with each successful round. If the defuser makes a mistake, the module will
explode immediately.

First, I need to check the serial number. The serial number is MKDHW1. Let me look at the rules for vowels. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. The letters in MKDHW1 are M, K, D, H, W, 1. None of these letters are vowels. So according to the second table, when there are no vowels, the color for round 1 is blue. 

Since the sequence is supposed to be red, but the correct color here is blue, the Defuser needs to press blue. Wait, but the sequence is red. Maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me check again. The flashing sequence
