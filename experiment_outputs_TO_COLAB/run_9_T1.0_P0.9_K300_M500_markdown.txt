## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

### Instruction

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The defuser needs to determine which single wire to cut from the bomb's wires, given the serial number and wire colors. The user provided the serial number as W2KOQW and the wires in red, red, yellow, black.

First, let's look at the wiring configuration. The serial number is W2KOQW. The wires are in colors: Wire 1 red, Wire 2 red, Wire 3 yellow, Wire 4 black. 

Now, the problem is to apply the rules based on the number of wires and their colors. The case here is a 3-Wire Case. According to the manual section for 3-Wire Module:

1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

Wait, in this case, there are two red wires. The last wire is black. So according to rule 3, regardless of the other conditions, cut the last wire. But let me double-check. The manual says: 

For 3-Wire Case:
1. If no red wires: cut 2nd wire.
2. Else if last is white: cut last.
3. Else: cut last.

Yes. Since there are red wires (both 1 and 2), but the last wire (Wire 4) is black. So the answer should be to cut the last wire (Wire 4), which is black. So the instruction would be to cut wire 4.

Cut wire 4.<|im_end|>

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The bomb has a serial number W2KOQW and wires colored red, red, yellow, black. The expert needs to determine which wire to cut based on the configuration.

First, the number of wires is 3: Wire 1, Wire 2, Wire 3. The colors are Red, Red, Yellow. Now, looking at the rules for the 3-Wire case:

1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire. But there are two red wires, so that rule doesn't apply.
2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut last. Here, the last wire is black, so this rule also doesn't apply.
3. Otherwise: Cut last wire. Since the last wire is black, this is the case.

So the correct action is to cut the last wire, which is black. The command would be to cut wire 4.<|im_end|>


[DEFUSER ACTION DECIDED]: cut wire 4
