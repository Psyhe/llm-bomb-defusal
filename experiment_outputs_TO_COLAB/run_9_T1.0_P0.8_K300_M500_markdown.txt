## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is in the Bomb State, and they provided the serial number, wire colors, and commands. The task is to determine which wire to cut based on the given rules.

First, I need to check the 6-Wire Case because that's the case where the rules are more specific. The serial number is TYGO8G. Let's break it down. The last digit is 8, which is even. The wires are yellow, red, blue, white, blue. So the order is Wire 1: yellow, Wire 2: red, Wire 3: blue, Wire 4: white, Wire 5: blue.

Looking at the 6-Wire Case instructions. The 1st condition says if there are no yellow wires, then cut the third wire. But there are yellow wires (Wire 1 and 5). So that's not the case. The second condition is if there's more than one red wire and the last digit is odd. The last digit is 8 (even), so that's not applicable. The third condition is if there are no black wires. There are no black wires mentioned here, so maybe that's not it. Wait, the 6-Wire Case says if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third wire. But there are yellow wires. So maybe the correct approach is to check all conditions.

Wait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me recheck. The 6-Wire Case instructions:

1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd: Cut third wire.
2. Else if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut fourth wire.
3. Else if no red wires: Cut last wire.
4. Otherwise: Cut fourth wire.

But in this case, there are yellow wires (Wires 1 and 5), so the first condition doesn't apply. The second condition says if there's exactly one yellow and more than one white. Let's check. There are two white wires (Wire 4). So that's one yellow and one white. So according to the second condition, we need to cut the fourth wire. But the fourth wire is white. Wait, the fourth wire is white. But the second condition says if there is exactly one yellow and more than one white. So yes, that applies. So the instruction would be

Okay, let's see. The 6-Wire Case has specific conditions. The serial number is TYGO8G. The wires are in the order yellow, red, blue, white, blue. The last digit is 8 (even). So for the 6-Wire Case, the first condition isn't met because there are yellow wires. The second condition is: if there's exactly one yellow and more than one white. There is one yellow (Wires 1 and 5) and two white (Wire 4). So that condition applies. According to the instruction, when the second condition is met, we cut the fourth wire. So the command would be to cut wire 4.
