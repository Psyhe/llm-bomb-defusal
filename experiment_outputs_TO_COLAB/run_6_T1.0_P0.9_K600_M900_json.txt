## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The problem is about a regular wires module where a defuser needs to determine which wire to cut based on a specific configuration and a serial number. Let's break down the input and the rules step by step.

First, the defuser has the available commands, which are cutting specific wires. The input provides the wires and the serial number. The output should be the command to execute.

Looking at the wires: Wire 1 is blue, 2 is black, 3 is black, 4 is blue, 5 is yellow, 6 is black. The serial number is RZ7GTB. The last digit of the serial number is 'B', which is odd. 

Now, let's look at the rules for each case. Starting with the 3-Wire case. The condition is if there are no red wires, cut the second. But here, there are two blue wires. So it's not the 3-Wire case. 

Next, the 4-Wire case. The serial number ends with 'B', which is odd. The rules for 4-Wire case:

1. If there are more than one red and last digit is odd: Cut the last red wire. But here, the wires are blue, black, black, blue. No red wires. So condition 1 is false. Then check if the last wire is yellow and no red: yes, it's yellow. So condition 2 applies: cut the first wire (wire 1). But wire 1 is blue. Wait, but the defuser can choose to cut any wire. However, the output requires the command. So maybe the output is "cut wire 1"? 

But let me check again. The 4-Wire case's second rule says: if the last wire is yellow and no red wires, cut the first. So in this case, the last wire is yellow (wire 5) and there are no red wires. So the command would be cut wire 1. 

But wait, the 4-Wire case says "if there is more than one red... else if..." So the first condition (if more than one red) is false. Then check if the last wire is yellow and no red. Yes, so cut the first wire. 

So the answer would be cut wire 1. Let me check other cases to be sure. 

5-Wire case: last digit is 'B' (odd). The condition is: if last wire is black and last digit is odd, cut fourth. The last wire here is wire 6 (black). So that's correct. So command is cut wire 4. 

But wait, the problem is that the input says the wires are given as:

Wire 1: blue

Wire 2: black

Wire 3: black

Wire 4: blue

Wire 5: yellow

Wire 6: black

So wire 5 is yellow, wire 6 is black. So the last wire is wire 6 (black). 

So for the 4-Wire case, the last wire is yellow (wire 5) and no red wires. Therefore, cut wire 1. 

Similarly, in the 5-Wire case, the last wire is black (wire 6) and last digit is B (odd). So cut wire 4. 

For the 6-Wire case: the last digit is B (odd), but the first condition is if there are no yellow wires. Wire 1 is blue, wire 3 is black, wire 4 is blue. So yellow wires are none. Therefore, the command is cut the third wire. 

Wait, but according to the 6-Wire case's rule: 1. If there are no yellow wires and last digit odd: cut third. So that applies. 

So the commands for each case would be:

3-Wire: not applicable.

4-Wire: cut 1.

5-Wire: cut 4.

6-Wire: cut 3.

So the output would be the commands for each case. But the input requires the output to be a single command. So maybe there's only one command to choose? But how? Let me check again.

Wait, the defuser has to determine which single wire to cut. So maybe the correct answer is to

So the answer would be cut wire 1. Let me check other cases to be sure. 

5-Wire case: last digit is 'B' (odd). The condition is: if last wire is black and last digit is odd, cut fourth. The last wire here is wire 6 (black). So that's correct. So command is cut wire 4. 

But wait, the problem is that the input says the wires are given as:

Wire 1: blue

Wire 2: black

Wire 3: black

Wire 4: blue

Wire 5: yellow

Wire 6: black

So wire 5 is yellow, wire 6 is black. So the last wire is wire 6 (black). 

So for the 4-Wire case, the last wire is yellow (wire 5) and no red wires. Therefore, cut wire 1. 

Similarly, in the 5-Wire case, the last wire is black (wire 6) and last digit is B (odd). So cut wire 4. 

For the 6-Wire case: the last digit is B (odd), but the first condition is if there are no yellow wires. Wire 1 is blue, wire 3 is black, wire 4 is blue. So yellow wires are none. Therefore, the command is cut the third wire. 

Wait, but according to the 6-Wire case's rule: 1. If there are no yellow wires and last digit odd: cut third. So that applies. 

So the commands for each case would be:

3-Wire: not applicable.

4-Wire: cut 1.

5-Wire: cut 4.

6-Wire: cut 3.

So the output would be the commands for each case. But the input requires the output to be a single command. So maybe there's only one command to choose? But how? Let me check again.

Okay, let's go step by step again. The defuser has the wires and the serial number. The problem is to find which wire to cut based on the given advice.

First, the wires are: wire1 (blue), wire2 (black), wire3 (black), wire4 (blue), wire5 (yellow), wire6 (black). The serial number is RZ7GTB, so the last digit is B, which is odd.

Looking at the advice for each case:

- For 3-Wire: no red, so cut wire 2. Not applicable here since there are no red.

- For 4-Wire: if no red and last wire is yellow, cut first. The last wire here is wire5 (yellow). So cut wire1.

- For 5-Wire: last wire black (wire6), so cut wire4.

- For 6-Wire: no yellow, so cut wire3.

So which case applies here? The 4-Wire case applies because wire5 is yellow, and there are no red wires. Therefore, the command should be cut wire1.

Therefore, the output is "cut wire 1".
