[EXPERT sees MANUAL]:
## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a problem where I need to determine which wire to cut based on the given configuration and serial number. The input has a 3-Wire Case, 4-Wire Case, 5-Wire Case, and 6-Wire Case. The defuser's observation is that the serial number is KGP5OQ and the wires are white, red, and blue. The available commands are cutting wire 1, 2, or 3.

First, I need to check which case applies here. The wires are 3 wires: Wire 1 is white, Wire 2 is red, Wire 3 is blue. The serial number is KGP5OQ. Let's look at the rules for each case.

Starting with the 3-Wire Case: The first rule says if no wires are red, cut the second. But here, there is one red wire. Then, if the last wire is white, cut the last. But the last wire here is blue. So that's not applicable. So in the 3-Wire Case, since there's a red wire, the second wire is cut. But wait, the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So according to this, the answer would be wire 2. But let me check the other cases to make sure.

The 4-Wire Case has more complex rules. The 5-Wire Case also has specific conditions. The 6-Wire Case is similar. But since the wires are only 3, maybe the 3-Wire Case applies. Let me confirm again. The 3-Wire Case's first rule is if no red, cut second. Since there is a red, the second wire is cut. So the answer would be wire 2. But wait, the available commands are cut wire 1, 2, or 3. So the correct command is cut wire 2. Therefore, the output should be cut wire 2.
