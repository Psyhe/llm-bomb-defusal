## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:
  1. If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the third wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.
  3. Else, if there are no red wires: Cut the last wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the fourth wire.

Okay, let's see. The defuser needs to determine which wire to cut from the bomb's configuration. The serial number is I4IUHN. The wires are blue, white, yellow, black, with serial number I4IUHN. 

First, I need to check the case type. The case is a 6-wire module because the serial number has 6 digits. The wires are in a 6-wire case. 

Looking at the 6-Wire Case instructions. The first condition is if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd. The last digit of the serial number is H, which is odd. So that condition applies. 

The second part of the instruction says if there are no yellow wires, cut the third wire. So the answer should be to cut wire 3. 

Wait, let me double-check. The serial number is I4IUHN. Let's count the digits: I (1), 4 (2), I (3), U (4), H (5), N (6). So the last digit is N, which is odd. The wires are blue, white, yellow, black. 

Now, the 6-Wire Case instructions: if there are no yellow wires and the last digit is odd, cut the third wire. Yes, that's correct. So the defuser should cut wire 3.

Cut wire 3.<|im_end|>
