## Regular Wires Module

This module presents a series of colored wires (between 3 and 6). The defuser will see the colors and order of the wires,
as well as the bomb's serial number. You must determine which single wire should be cut based on the specific configuration
of wire colors and the serial number.

- 3-Wire Case:
  1. If no wires are red: Cut the second wire.
  2. Otherwise, if the last wire is white: Cut the last wire.
  3. Otherwise: Cut the last wire.

- 4-Wire Case:
  1. If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the last red wire.
  2. Else, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there is exactly one blue wire: Cut the first wire.
  4. Else, if there is more than one yellow wire: Cut the last wire.
  5. Otherwise: Cut the second wire.

- 5-Wire Case:
  1. If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd: Cut the fourth wire.
  2. Else, if there is exactly one red wire and more than one yellow wire: Cut the first wire.
  3. Else, if there are no black wires: Cut the second wire.
  4. Otherwise: Cut the first wire.

- 6-Wire Case:

  2. Else, if there is exactly one yellow wire and more than one white wire: Cut the fourth wire.

[EXPERT sees MANUAL]:
## The Button Module

This module presents a single colored button with a text label. The defuser will see the button's color, label, 
number of batteries, and any lit indicators on the bomb. Based on these attributes, you must determine whether 
the defuser should press and immediately release the button, or hold it and release at a specific time.

1. Primary Analysis (Button Color and Label):
   - If the button is blue and labeled "Abort": Hold the button.
   - If there is more than one battery and the button says "Detonate": Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is white and there is a lit indicator labeled CAR: Hold the button.
   - If there are more than two batteries and a lit indicator labeled FRK is present: Press and immediately release the button.
   - If the button is yellow: Hold the button.
   - If the button is red and the button says "Hold": Press and immediately release the button.
   - Otherwise: Hold the button.

2. Releasing a Held Button (if required):
   When a held button produces a colored strip on its side, release when:
   - Blue strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 4.
   - White strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 1.
   - Yellow strip: Release when the countdown timer shows any 5.
   - Any other color: Release when the timer shows any 1.
